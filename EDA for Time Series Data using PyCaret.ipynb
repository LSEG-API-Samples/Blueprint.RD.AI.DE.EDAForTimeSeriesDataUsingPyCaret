    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "In this article, we are going to ingest time-series data using the Refinitiv Data Library and perform exploratory data analysis using the beta version of Pycaret, a “low-code” library that can be used to significantly decrease research and experimentation time. This can be done through various builtin tools that can very quickly provide important insight on the datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refinitiv Data Library\n",
    "The Refinitiv Data Library for Python provides a set of easy-to-use interfaces offering our clients uniform programmatic access to the breadth and depth of financial data and services available on the Refinitiv Data Platform. The platform consists of data service layers that can provide streaming and non-streaming content as well as bulk content and a lot more, serving different client types from the desktop user to an enterprise application. Using the Refinitiv Data Library, the same Python code can be used to retrieve data regardless of which access point you choose to connect to the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PyCaret\n",
    "PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that can automate machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that speeds up the experiment cycle exponentially therefore making data science teams more productive. It is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and more. Pycaret recently released a Time Series Module which comes with a lot of handy features that can make time series modeling a breeze."

The ACF is a time domain measure of the correlation between two datapoints and how that changes as the distance between them increases. If in a time series there is no correlation of the signal with itself in time then autocorrelation remains zero, such would be the case with white noise.  Let's plot ACF for the Price close time series, pycaret will also provide a confidence band cone. The default is 95% confidence bands and essentially we can say that points that fall outside of the band impose an impact with a probability of more than 95%."
