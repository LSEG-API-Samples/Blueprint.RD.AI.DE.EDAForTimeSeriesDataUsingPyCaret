# EDA for Time Series Data using PyCaret


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
In this article, we are going to ingest time-series data using the Refinitiv Data Library and perform exploratory data analysis using the beta version of Pycaret, a “low-code” library that can be used to significantly decrease research and experimentation time. This can be done through various builtin tools that can very quickly provide important insight on the datasets.

Details and concepts are further explained in the [Data Engineering - Exploratory Data Analysis for Time Series Data using PyCaret](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/ai-data-engineering-eda-for-time-series-data-using-pycaret) article published on the [Refinitiv Developer Community portal](https://developers.refinitiv.com).

## <a id="disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer
The source code presented in this project has been written by Refinitiv only for the purpose of illustrating the concepts of creating example scenarios using the Refinitiv Data Library for Python.
